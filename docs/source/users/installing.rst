====================
Prerequisite: Python
====================

Before you install ``latools``, you'll need to make sure you have a working installation of Python, preferably version 3.5+. 
If you don't already have this (or are unsure if you do), we recommend that you install one of the pre-packaged science-oriented Python distributions, like Continuum's `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.
This provides a working copy of Python, and most of the modules that ``latools`` relies on.

If you already have a working Python installation or don't want to install one of the pre-packaged Python distributions, everything below `should` work.

.. tip:: Make sure you set the Anaconda Python installation as the system default, or you are working in a virtual environment that uses the correct Python version. If you don't know what a virtual environment' is, don't worry - just make sure you check the box saying 'make this my default Python' at the appropriate time when installing Anaconda.
